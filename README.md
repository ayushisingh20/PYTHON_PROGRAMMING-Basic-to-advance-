# PYTHON_PROGRAMMING-Basic-to-advance


Python is a programming language that's easy to use and versatile. It's popular for its readability and simplicity. Here are some key points:

#Interpreted Language:

Python is not compiled before running; instead, it's interpreted on the fly. This makes the development process faster.

#Object-Oriented:

Python supports object-oriented programming, a style of coding that organizes data and functions into reusable structures called objects.

#High-Level Language:

Python is a high-level language, meaning it's closer to human language than machine language. This makes it easy for people to read and write.

#Dynamic Semantics:

Python has dynamic semantics, allowing for flexible and adaptable code. Types are determined at runtime, making it more forgiving for certain errors.

#Built-in Data Structures:

Python comes with built-in data structures like lists and dictionaries, making it convenient for handling and organizing data.

#Dynamic Typing and Dynamic Binding:

Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to declare the type of a variable. It also supports dynamic binding, which means that the interpretation of types can happen at runtime.

#Rapid Application Development (RAD):

Python is great for rapid application development due to its simplicity and ease of use. The edit-test-debug cycle is quick.

#Scripting and Glue Language:

Python is often used as a scripting language, allowing you to automate repetitive tasks. It's also used as a glue language to connect different software components.

#Readability:

Python's syntax is designed to be readable and clean. This reduces the cost of program maintenance and makes it easy for new developers to understand existing code.

#Extensive Standard Library:

Python comes with a large standard library, providing modules and packages that help with common tasks. This encourages code modularity and reuse.

#Free and Open Source:

Python is free to use and distribute. The interpreter and standard library are available without charge for all major platforms.

#Debugging:

Python makes debugging easier with features like exceptions and a source-level debugger. The quick edit-test-debug cycle is facilitated by the absence of a compilation step.
